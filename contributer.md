<h2 align="center">Thanks for your contribute to the Repository 🎉💡</h2>

### How to contribute ✔ ?

If you'd like to contribute, start by searching through the issues and pull requests to see whether someone else has raised a similar idea or question.

If you don't see your idea listed, and you think it fits into the goals of this guide, do one of the following:
- If your contribution is minor, such as a typo fix, open a pull request.
- If your contribution is major, such as a new guide, start by opening an issue first. That way, other people can weigh in on the discussion before you do any work.

#### Steps to Contribute⚡🍀✨!

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use Github Flow). We actively welcome your pull requests:
- Fork the repo and create your branch from master.
- Write clear meaningful git commit messages.
- Make sure your code lints.
- Issue that pull request!
